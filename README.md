# git Together
A fullstack MERN application (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with CRUD capability on multiple models that allow you track, project-manage, and share your GitHub projects in a visually appealing way with social accountability. The app utilizes the GitHub API for data requests, JSON Web Token for authorization/authentication, and Mongoose models/schemas for data structures. The app is deployed to Heroku and can be accessed and used [here](https://git-together-tspfe.herokuapp.com/).

### About git Together
#### **The problems:**
Unclear project status, low motivation, only understandable to other devs

Software development projects often get created and half-finished, and the way repositories are displayed on GitHub make them all look the same, regardless of the content or current status/progress. Projects on GitHub are only understandable to other developers, and not to without a technical background. 
#### **The solution:**
Full project status clarity, social accountability, ability to share with everyone!

The app converts your GitHub repositories into a visual project manager so you can see where your projects are, work toward your goals and milestones, and showcase finished products. It includes a social feed where people can comment on you hitting your milestones/completing projects, and check out other people’s projects to encourage each other/hold each other accountable to completing projects.
 
#### **Mission statement:**
git Together makes what it takes to reach your GitHub project completion goals extremely clear, and helps you receive social accountability along the way.
 
The app intends to create motivation/encouragement, help complete more projects, and translate the coding journey into a visually understandable process, so that even people without a coding background can appreciate them and be encouraged to start their own coding journey.

### How to Use the App
To use this app, you have to create an account and link up your GitHub account. From there, you create a new project from a linked GitHub repository, and add project deadlines and goals/milestones to the project. The app shows you the current status of your project with a progress bar that dynamically updates with your milestone completion so you can see how far you are. Beyond your own projects tracking functionality, the app  allows you to post in a social feed to share your progress with others and leave comments to encourage each other. You are also able to view other people’s projects. 
 
### Wireframing, ERDs, Psuedocoding
Our initial [wireframe](https://whimsical.com/unit-3-project-wireframe-the-snake-pit-JLHXbBrUyhi3ZJcjXdooTL) actually matches pretty closely what we set out to build. The [ERD](https://whimsical.com/githubpm-erd-QXm8oWvtMhmKt3HwNtCq8E) on the other hand we had to refactor a couple times and ended up with three models with full CRUD functionality and an additional CRD model when initially we expected to have at most just two. 
 
### Stretch Goals
Some other goals and features we wanted to add was an auto-posting feature in the social feed when a milestone is hit to encourage more sharing, as well as add a commenting model to the project.
